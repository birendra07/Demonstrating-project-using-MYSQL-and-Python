# Demonstrating-project-using-MYSQL-and-Python
This is the project which combines the application of SQL and Python. This project aims to provide users with a simple banking service.
This project is the combination of applicatin of SQL and Python.
In this project, I am demonstrating the internal functions of a simple MoBank applications.
For this, I am asking the customer to first register their account info like their first name, last name, age, accountnumber and password. 
After the successfull registration, the user are provided with a simple banking services such as checking balance, depositing their money
to their bank account, similarly providing them the service to withdraw money from their account, the user also can check the bank's interest
rate and the list of the holidays.
For this , I am creating a MySQL database named accountholder which contains two columns i.e customer account number and 
the password where user's account holder is the primary key of the database. Then I want to store the user's account number and password.
Whenever they wish to login, the app simply ask the user to input their account name and password then 
i simply check the account number and password in order to match the user's typed account number and the password.
If it matches in the database then giving acess to the user for the banking service.
After this, the system asks the user to type number between 1 to 6, if the user enter 1, they the user can check the balance.
Similarly, if the user enter 2, then the user can deposit the money to their bank account.
If the user enter 3, then the user can withdraw money from the account. If the user enter 4, 
he or she can check the bank's interest rate and if the user has typed 5 then the user can check the 
list of the holidays. Finally, if the user has typed 6, then they can sucessfully log out of the application.
The next condition is if it is the first time of the user and the user want to register his or her account inorder to 
get the banking services, first the user should provide all the required info such as fist name, last name, age, account number and password. After
registering the user get the service to use the banking services like the above one.

During this project, I got chance to revise the fundamental concepts of python. Concepts of collective datatype, OOPs, modules , functions,
conditional statement and loops are the primary concepts used in this project. Similarly, some basic concepts of SQL are also used in the project.
The aim of the project was to mix the application of SQL and Python.
